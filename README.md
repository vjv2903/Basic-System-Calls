# Basic-System-Calls
Imeplements some basic system calls in c
## Part 1:
Given a file, you need to reverse the contents of the file and store the
result in a new file in the directory named “Assignment”. The percentage
of the file written should be printed on the console during file writing. The
directory created should have read, write and execute permissions for the
user who created it. The new file created should have the read and write
permissions for the user who created it. Program will be tested on ​ LARGE
(> 1GB)​ files.
### Example:
#### Input:
‘A.txt’ -> “My name is abcd”
#### Output:
‘Assignment/A.txt’ -> “dcba si eman yM”
### Note : During execution, the percentage of the file written should be
overwritten each time (shouldn’t write multiple times).
## Part 2:
Write a program to
1. Check the permissions for the two files and the directory.
2. Check whether the contents in the new file are the reverse of the old
file.
The input to this program has paths for newfile, oldfile and the directory.
